# Goal: Build an Enhanced Hybrid Chatbot

- This chatbot processes user queries against a given PDF using LlamaIndex, Ollama LLM, and optional Google Search.
- It applies Retrieval-Augmented Correction (RAC) to extract, verify, and correct factual claims from the LLMâ€™s response.
- It uses Confidence Cascade to suppress or flag answers based on verification confidence.
- Supports toggleable RAC,settable verification mode (local, web, hybrid), and stats tracking.
- Embedding model (e.g., `nomic-embed-text`) is switchable via `Settings.embed_model`.
- Designed to prioritize formal correctness, avoid hallucinations, and support both exploratory and cautious answer generation.
